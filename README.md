- Here's the tiniest possible mockup of our system
- To use:
  - "Run All" in `sim.ipynb` to produce a `data.js` file
  - Open `index.html` in a browser and you should see a plot like the one below
- Your task: 
  - **Add to this in what ever way best shows off your unique skills + creativity!**


### Some Project Ideas

- Sim Bed:
  - Improve the Q-Range KV Store data structure
  - Make the system more generic/extensible
  - Make it fast
- Front End:
  - Set up a framework like React
  - Add cool visualizations
  - Improve efficiency/caching
- Data:
  - Utilize a better persistence layer than a js file
  - Do some statistical analysis on the data
  - Set up background jobs to preprocess data
- Mod Sim:
  - Improve the numerical stability of the simulation functions
  - Implement new components
  - Analyze the sensitivity to initial conditions
- Etc
  - Port to a language of your choice
  - Set up testing
  - Containerize
- Whatever you want; these are just suggestions to get you thinking
